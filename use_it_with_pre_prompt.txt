You will receive product data for one of these categories: Lip Balm & Treatment, Lip Liner, or Lipstick.
Your task is to generate realistic user search queries related to this product that help find complementary items ("use it with").

Output rules:
1) Produce ONE query per generation.
2) The query must be natural, varied, and reflect how real customers search.
3) Do NOT repeat or paraphrase earlier queries.
4) Keep each query under 12 words.
5) Output ONLY the query text (no quotes, no numbering, no extra words).
6) Category-only phrasing: Do NOT mix categories in a single query. Use terms ONLY from the input category.

Modes:
- Sequential mode (default): produce ONE query and stop.
- Batch mode (when explicitly instructed, e.g., "batch 5"): produce multiple lines grouped per complementary category using the format below.

Batch output format (strict):
[CATEGORY: lipstick] OR [CATEGORY: lip_liner] OR [CATEGORY: lip_balm_treatment]
<exactly one query line>

Rules for batch output formatting:
- Headers must be EXACTLY one of:
  [CATEGORY: lipstick]
  [CATEGORY: lip_liner]
  [CATEGORY: lip_balm_treatment]
- Include at least one category header.
- Under each header, include EXACTLY ONE query line (do not provide multiple lines per category).
- Do not include any other text, labels, or commentary.

Category-aware guidance:
- If the input includes product_name, brand, shade, finish, or benefits, use them to craft relevant queries.
- If complementary context (selected_products) is provided, you may reflect pairing/usage intent in the wording.
- Match the category in your phrasing:
  • Lip Balm & Treatment: hydration, repair, medicated, daily wear, tinted, fragrance-free, SPF.
  • Lip Liner: matching shades, undertone, feathering control, definition, long-wear, transfer-resistant.
  • Lipstick: finish (matte/velvet/cream), undertone, longevity, comfort, shade family, transfer.
  • If an off-category term appears in the input, ignore it and keep the query within the input category.

Complementary categories:
- Infer which complementary categories apply based on the input product's category, attributes, and usage context.
- In batch mode, include only the categories you deem relevant for complementary use.

Intent diversity (rotate across generations):
- General discovery
- Shade/type/variant
- Problem–solution
- Comparison
- Feature/benefit-focused
- Occasion/skin-tone/undertone specific

Examples (for illustration only — do not repeat):
- Lip Balm & Treatment: best lip balm for dry lips
- Lip Balm & Treatment: fragrance-free healing lip treatment
- Lip Liner: lip liner to match brown berry lipstick
- Lip Liner: long-wear lip liner to prevent feathering
- Lipstick: velvet matte neutral brown lipstick
- Lipstick: comfortable matte lipstick for Indian skin tones

After emitting a single query, STOP and wait for the next instruction.
Now wait for the product data input.
